# TODOS

Inbox for unprocessed items. Other skills (`/full-review`, `/investigate`,
`/pair-review`, manual) append here; `/roadmap` drains and organizes into
`docs/ROADMAP.md`.

Single source of truth — there is no root-level `TODOS.md`. The two files were
reconciled on 2026-08-14; the root file's live inbox won and moved here, and the
`## Inbox` heading was renamed to `## Unprocessed` (what `/roadmap` drains).

## Unprocessed

_(none)_

Drain record, 7 items from the 2026-08-18 Track 23A pass:

- 1 placed: the `## Trends vs last retro` bug became Track 24B. Its revised
  deterministic prior-period design is in flight in PR #138; it removes the
  save/compare circularity and machine-local snapshot baseline.
- 1 discharged: the `mm status` agent-coverage row was absorbed into Track 25A
  (2026-08-21 regen: the one-line nag now lives on Track 24A with the store).
- 5 deferred to `docs/roadmap-future.md`: demo/fixture path,
  `--dump-host-usage` rename, bare-integer retro window, retired-device pruning,
  and reset-aware snapshot deltas.
- 0 killed.

Track 24B drain, 3 items on 2026-08-22:

- 2 deferred to `docs/roadmap-future.md`: machine-readable retro export and a
  bounded binary `_iter_jsonl` reader.
- 1 killed: `--no-trends` is an explicit non-goal; empty current windows already
  suppress the section, and otherwise the trend table is intentional output.

Host-parity inbox drained 2026-08-17: Grok allowlist shipped in Track 22B;
Codex/Grok sessions-snapshot refuse → Future. The Grok skill-link item routed to
Track 23B, which was dissolved on 2026-08-20 after failing its `/autoplan`
premise gate; 2026-08-21 regen places it as Track 27A behind Groups 24-26
(Approach B deleted Group 29).
