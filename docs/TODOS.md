# TODOS

Inbox for unprocessed items. Other skills (`/full-review`, `/investigate`,
`/pair-review`, manual) append here; `/roadmap` drains and organizes into
`docs/ROADMAP.md`.

Single source of truth — there is no root-level `TODOS.md`. The two files were
reconciled on 2026-08-14; the root file's live inbox won and moved here, and the
`## Inbox` heading was renamed to `## Unprocessed` (what `/roadmap` drains).

## Unprocessed

### [manual] Retire the 0.12.42 policy-transition machinery when Track 28A lands

- **Why:** The one-time upgrade notice is dead weight once every fleet machine
  has acknowledged it, and `mm uninstall-skills` (Track 28A) is the release that
  makes it redundant — 28A gives users a supported way to decline a link, which
  is the thing the notice exists to explain.
- **Effort:** S (~60 lines deleted)
- **Depends on:** Track 28A
- **Priority:** P3
- **Context:** Filed against "Track 26A" by a parallel workspace on 2026-08-25;
  retargeted to 28A by the same day's regen, which renumbered the uninstall
  Track. Reformatted from a compact bullet to this grammar in the same commit —
  as filed, `roadmap-audit` reported `UNPROCESSED: ITEMS: 0` and the item would
  never have been drained.

Delete together, or the marker name outlives its own reason:
`_POLICY_TRANSITION_MARKER`, `policy_transition_text`,
`maybe_emit_policy_transition`, `declined_owned_link_rows`,
`policy_transition_acknowledged`, `acknowledge_policy_transition`
(`skill_link.py`), the three call sites in `cli.py` (push, `status`,
`install_skills_cmd`), the `mm status` clause in the README command table, and
the README Troubleshooting entry added 2026-08-25.

Leave `consented_agent_keys` / `_row_is_consented` / `AgentRow.consent_source` —
that is the permanent policy, not the migration.

Note the marker file `~/.config/mind-meld/.skill-link-policy-v0.12.42` becomes
orphaned state on every fleet machine; `mm gc` does not reap it, so decide
reap-or-leave as part of the same change.

Regen drain, 2026-08-25 — nothing from the inbox, which was already empty. Recorded
because the run's whole yield came from reconciling against git rather than from
filed items:

- 2 Tracks closed from ground truth: 25B shipped as v0.12.41 and 25C as v0.12.42,
  both still listed unshipped at HEAD three releases later. Group 25 → Shipped.
- 1 Group minted for unplanned shipped work: v0.12.43's Grok skill-discovery probe
  became Group 26, so the 27A kill has a visible cause.
- 1 Track killed: 27A (Grok row). v0.12.43 shipped the opposite conclusion plus a
  written exit criterion that refuses the row. Group 27 tombstoned.
- 1 item promoted from `docs/roadmap-future.md`: "Regenerate the roadmap AFTER a
  Track lands" → Track 28B. Sixth occurrence; the deferral reason ("a process
  convention, not a Track") is refuted by this repo's own PROGRESS-row history,
  where a convention line failed twice and a pytest fixed it.
- 2 of 3 leftover task premises on the old 26A had rotted and were rewritten with
  this-turn evidence rather than re-emitted. 0 discharged.

Track 25B `/autoplan` drain, 5 items on 2026-08-22:

- 1 placed: `mm uninstall-skills` became **Track 26A** (new Group 26, between
  Install consent and the Grok row). Placed rather than deferred because the
  installer's `absent target -> symlink -> installed` branch re-creates a
  manually deleted link on the next interactive push, so there is currently no
  supported way to decline the skill — and shipping the Grok row first would
  orphan a fourth link on every uninstall.
- 4 deferred to `docs/roadmap-future.md`: the `mm skill-run --protocol N`
  handshake, the `mm status` store-vs-binary skew nag, the README agent-name
  doc-lint, and the process fix for regenerating the roadmap after a Track
  lands rather than only before.
- 0 killed. 0 discharged.

Drain record, 7 items from the 2026-08-18 Track 23A pass:

- 1 placed: the `## Trends vs last retro` bug became Track 24B. Its revised
  deterministic prior-period design is in flight in PR #138; it removes the
  save/compare circularity and machine-local snapshot baseline.
- 1 discharged: the `mm status` agent-coverage row was absorbed into Track 25A
  (2026-08-21 regen: the one-line nag now lives on Track 24A with the store).
- 5 deferred to `docs/roadmap-future.md`: demo/fixture path,
  `--dump-host-usage` rename, bare-integer retro window, retired-device pruning,
  and reset-aware snapshot deltas.
- 0 killed.

Track 24B drain, 3 items on 2026-08-22:

- 2 deferred to `docs/roadmap-future.md`: machine-readable retro export and a
  bounded binary `_iter_jsonl` reader.
- 1 killed: `--no-trends` is an explicit non-goal; empty current windows already
  suppress the section, and otherwise the trend table is intentional output.

Host-parity inbox drained 2026-08-17: Grok allowlist shipped in Track 22B;
Codex/Grok sessions-snapshot refuse → Future. The Grok skill-link item routed to
Track 23B, which was dissolved on 2026-08-20 after failing its `/autoplan`
premise gate; 2026-08-21 regen places it as Track 27A behind Groups 24-26
(Approach B deleted Group 29).

Track 25A `/autoplan` drain, 1 item on 2026-08-22:

- 1 deferred to `docs/roadmap-future.md`: unify the seven per-agent enumerations
  across five modules. The `/autoplan` run also falsified Track 25A's premise
  (pytest never writes the real `~/.grok/skills`; the defect is silent `zip()`
  truncation), so 25A was retitled and re-scoped, Group 24 moved to Shipped, and
  the packer re-roomed the old 26A with 25A as Track 25B.
- 0 placed from the inbox: `## Unprocessed` was already empty.
