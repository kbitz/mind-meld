# Progress

## Version history

| Version | Released | Headline |
|---------|----------|----------|
| 0.5.0   | 2026-04-22 | Rename memsync/msync → mind-meld/mm |
| 0.4.0   | 2026-04-21 | Conflict-copy preservation + mtime-skip for pull |
| 0.3.0   | (pre-v0.4) | Additive-only sync model with tombstones and conflict resolution |
| 0.2.0   | (pre-v0.3) | Multi-source sync with gstack support |
| 0.1.x   | (pre-v0.2) | iCloud-only backend, autopull/autopush for Claude Code; scoped sync to memory/todos |

## Current phase: pre-1.0 cleanup sweep (v0.x → v1.0)

All work is driving toward a single v1.0 release that cleans up correctness
bugs, decomposition debt, and multi-source assumption lag from the five prior
PRs, then layers on three pre-1.0 features (selective sync, mtime hash cache,
three-way merge base).

See `docs/ROADMAP.md` for the structured Groups > Tracks > Tasks plan.

### Where we are

- **Group 1 (Correctness foundation):** not started — blocks everything.
- **Groups 2–6 (Refactor + hygiene):** not started — queued after Group 1.
- **Groups 7–9 (P2/P3 features, parallel-safe after Group 6):** not started.

### Version source of truth

`pyproject.toml` is the single source of truth for the release number.
`src/mind_meld/__init__.py` reads it at import time via
`importlib.metadata.version("mind-meld")` and falls back to `"0.0.0+dev"`
when the package is not installed (source-tree runs). There is no
separate `VERSION` file.
